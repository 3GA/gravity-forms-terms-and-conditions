Gravity Forms Terms and Conditions
==================================

Simple gravity forms field for requiring the user accept terms and conditions before submitting the form. This differs from similar plugins in that the terms are shown in a modal dialog triggered by a text link in the checkbox label.

Tested only with GF 1.8.7 and WP 3.9.1

** This plugin currently requires [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) to be installed for the modal dialog to work **

The new field appears under the "Advanced"-tab labelled "Terms".
